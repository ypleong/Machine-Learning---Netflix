\section{Conclusion}

From our analysis, we were able to visualize movies along their top 2 principal components, which captured the most variance in movie ???ratings. However, from our visualization plots, there seems to be little human-understandable correlation between movies that are close together in the 2 principal component dimensions. To us, it seemed that many movies that were quite different to each other ended up close together in the 2D visualization. 

Furthermore, when looking at the mean movie coordinates for each genre, it at first suggested a correlation between genre and position along the principal components (e.g. Documentary and Children are far from each other in the Principal Component space). However, when we look at the standard deviation among each genre along both the x-axis and y-axis, this correlation becomes quite unreliable as the variance for each genre is so high. 

It seems then that the meaning of each principal component is not easily human-understandable. Our best hypothesis for the x-axis principal component is that...
